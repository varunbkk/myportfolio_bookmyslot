# My portfolio - BookMySlot

BookMySlot is a booking portal developed in Django that enables users to create booking slots on specified date(s) and time(s) for their deliveries to a distribution center (DC)

Users can update/delete a specific booking and view all existing bookings, which is accomplished via Django's Class-Based Views.

Bootstrap4 and CSS handle bulk of the portal's styling.
